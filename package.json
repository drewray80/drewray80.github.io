The intent of this site is to share teaching resources to anyone that would like to use them.   I store resources on GitHub. I found that many K12 teachers are not familiar with GitHub.  Since navigating GitHub can be challenging, and I wanted to learn and practice more web development. I thought I would use this github pages to help visitors navigate my repro and share some projects that I am also working on.",
