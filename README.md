## Site purpose
I am just starting to build this website (in the winter of 2024/25).  
It will take me a while in my limited spare time to get it organized well.  
The intent of this site is to share teaching resources to anyone that would like to use them.  
I store resources on GitHub. I found that many K12 teachers are not familiar with GitHub.  Since navigating GitHub can be challenging, and I wanted to learn and practice more web development. I thought I would use this github pages to help visitors navigate my repro and share some projects that I am also working on.
