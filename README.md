## Site purpose
I am just starting to build this website (in the winter of 2024/25).  
It will take me a while in my limited spare time to get it organized well.  
The intent of this site is to share teaching resources to anyone that would like to use them.  

I store resources on GitHub.  
I have found that many K12 teachers are not familiar with GitHub.  And navigating GitHub can be challenging.  
So, I thought I would use this GitHub Pages site to help visitors navigate my repros and share some projects that I am working on.  
Plus, I wanted to learn and practice more web development, and I thought this would be a useful project.
