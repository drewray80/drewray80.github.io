## Site purpose
I am just starting to build this website (in the winter of 2024/25).  
It will take me a while in my limited spare time to get it organized well.  
The intent of this site is to share teaching resources to anyone that would like to use them.  

I store resources on GitHub.  
I have found that many K12 teachers are not familiar with GitHub.  And navigating GitHub can be challenging.  
So, I thought I would use this GitHub Pages site to help visitors navigate my repros and share some projects that I am working on.  

Plus, I wanted to learn and practice more web development, and I thought this would be a useful project.  I built this website using basic html, javascript and tailwind css.  
I started my process of learning tailwind css using these two videos:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M8znNpim8dRiICRrP5HPft  
I really like those tutorials. They were very helpful as I was getting started.  
Then I moved forward on my own to create sites that match my content.
